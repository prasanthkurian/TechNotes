__init__ ->> contructor
__del__  destructor



class test:
	def __init__(self):
		pass
	def __del__(self):
		pass

__del__ is called during automatic garbage collection when reference count becomes zero
and  when "del object" is called



Also with statement __enter__ and __exit__ are also good to look into
