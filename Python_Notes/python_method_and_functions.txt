Function vs method
--------------------

OOP context.:
A function is a pience of code that is called by a name. it can have arguments to operate on and can optionally return value.

A method is a piece of code that is called by a name and that is associated with an object.In most repects it is identical to a function but has two key differences.
	1. A method is implicitely passed the object on whitch it is called.
	2. A method id able to operate on data that is contained within the class.



Python adheres to above rule
----------------------------

function is a callable object in python

def fun():
	pass

>>> def a(): pass
>>> a
<function a at 0x107063aa0>
>>> type(a)
 <type 'function'>
method is a special class  in python that can bound or unbound


class myClass:
	def A():
		pass


>>> class A:
	def a(self): pass
>>> A.a
<unbound method A.a>
>>>type(A.a)
<bound method A.a of <__main__.A instance at >
>>>type(A().a)
<type 'instancemethod'>
